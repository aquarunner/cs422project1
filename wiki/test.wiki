The vendor app was created exclusively with [http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qtquick.html QtQuick / QML] with some Javascript helping along.  To get started using it you must download and install [http://qt.nokia.com/products/qt-sdk/ the Qt SDK] by Nokia.  Please review below for additional detail.


Please direct any questions or issues regarding the application directly to me.  You may email directly at dyoung24 *omit the bold* @uic.edu
